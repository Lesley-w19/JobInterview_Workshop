Asked for permission to extract and analyze StudyMaterials.zip.\n\n**User:** Yes, go ahead and extract and analyze the contents of the ZIP file now.\n\n**Assistant:** Extracted notebooks; summarized seven workshops and produced a 500-word summary.\n\n**User:** I have just added the DecisionTreeWorkshop notebook... are you okay with that?\n\n**Assistant:** Yes, re-upload and I\u2019ll integrate it.\n\n**User:** Using the new files uploaded, re-do the first prompt...\n\n**Assistant:** Extracted new ZIP (included DecisionTreeRegression_Workshop.ipynb). Produced updated 500-word summary including Decision Trees.\n\n**User:** Reformat into an interview-ready speaking version.\n\n**Assistant:** Delivered an interview-style narrative.\n\n**User:** Summarize StudyGuide in 100 words for the job interview.\n\n**Assistant:** Provided 100-word summary.\n\n**User:** Ignore interview-oriented phrasing. Provide 100-word summary again.\n\n**Assistant:** Provided a clear 100-word summary.\n\n**User:** Match the study guide and study materials; produce a table of coverage vs. gaps.\n\n**Assistant:** Parsed notebooks, matched keywords, created and shared a CSV coverage report.\n\n**User:** Start quiz.\n\n**Assistant:** Ran a 15-question A\u2013E quiz one at a time. Results below:\n\nQ1: A (Correct) \u2014 Supervised vs Unsupervised  \nQ2: C (Correct) \u2014 Dependent variable role  \nQ3: C (Correct) \u2014 Validation set purpose  \nQ4: B (Correct) \u2014 Residual definition  \nQ5: C (Correct) \u2014 Regression metric (MSE)  \nQ6: B (Correct) \u2014 Sigmoid in logistic regression  \nQ7: A (Incorrect; Correct: D) \u2014 KNN bias\u2013variance effect of larger k  \nQ8: C (Correct) \u2014 Decision tree split metrics  \nQ9: C (Correct) \u2014 R-squared definition  \nQ10: B (Incorrect; Correct: C) \u2014 Cross-entropy meaning  \nQ11: A (Correct) \u2014 True Positive definition  \nQ12: C (Incorrect; Correct: A) \u2014 Linear regression slope meaning  \nQ13: B (Correct) \u2014 MLOps model monitoring  \nQ14: C (Incorrect; Correct: D) \u2014 Not a KNN hyperparameter (learning rate)  \nQ15: B (Correct) \u2014 Pruning reduces overfitting\n\n**Assistant:** Score: 12/15 (80%). Missed: Q7, Q10, Q12 (and clarified Q14). Next step: tailored workshop notebook.\n\n**User:** Yes please, generate the notebook now.\n\n**Assistant:** Created JobInterviewGuide_Workshop/JobInterviewGuide.ipynb with markdown, TODOs, sanity checks; shared link.\n\n**User:** Generate a lightweight README.md and a solutions version.\n\n**Assistant:** Added README.md and JobInterviewGuide_Solutions.ipynb; shared links.\n\n**User:** Re-do step: create JobInterviewGuide_Workshop.ipynb tailored to missed topics and include a reflection prompt.\n\n**Assistant:** Created JobInterviewGuide_Workshop/JobInterviewGuide_Workshop.ipynb; shared link.\n\n**User:** Write ~150 words of reflection here.\n\n**Assistant:** Provided a polished 150-word reflection text.\n\n**User:** Add a new notebook JobInterviewLLMSession.ipynb containing the entire LLM session; provide a downloadable file.\n\n**Assistant:** (This notebook is the transcript export.)\n"
